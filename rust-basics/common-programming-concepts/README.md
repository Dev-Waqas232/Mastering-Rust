# Common Programming Concepts

## Variables

- Variables in rust are by default immutable

- We can make it mutable by using mut keyword after let keyword

- We can't reassign the value of different type to mutable variable

- We can also define constants using const keyword ( we only use them for hardcoded values )

- We also need to define the type of the const variable

- Shadowing means that we can redefine a variable with the same name and the variable defined later will be used and the pre one will be shadowed by the compiler
